# Hotel Scraper and API Service

## Project Description
This project provides a web scraping and API service for collecting detailed hotel information from Booking.com. It consists of two main components:

1. **Web Scraper**: A Python-based scraper that extracts hotel information such as address, images, room types, amenities, and reviews.
2. **Flask API**: A RESTful API built using Flask that allows users to interact with the scraper and retrieve hotel data in JSON format or save it as a downloadable file.

## Features
- Scrape hotel details from Booking.com for specific cities in Egypt.
- Extract information such as address, amenities, room types, and images.
- Save the scraped data as JSON files.
- API endpoints to:
  - Retrieve city codes for scraping.
  - Start a scraping process and get results.
  - Download scraped data as a file.

## File Structure

### 1. `booking_hotels.py`
This file contains the core scraping logic, implemented in the `Scraper` class.

**Key Features:**

- Parses hotel information using BeautifulSoup.
- Handles multiple cities and pagination for comprehensive scraping.
- Saves scraped data in JSON format.

### 2. `app.py`
This file implements the Flask API service, enabling interaction with the scraper.

**Endpoints:**
1. **`GET /codes`**: Returns a list of city codes for scraping.
   - **Response Format**:
     ```json
     {
       "cairo": "290692",
       "alexandria": "290263",
       ...
     }
     ```

2. **`GET /scrape`**: Initiates the scraping process.
   - **Query Parameters:**
     - `city`: Name of the city to scrape (required).
     - `city_code`: City code for Booking.com (required).
     - `pages`: Number of pages to scrape (default: 1).
     - `format`: Output format (`json` or `file`).
   - **Response:**
     - Returns hotel data in JSON format or a download link to the JSON file.

3. **`GET /download/<file_name>`**: Downloads a previously saved JSON file.
